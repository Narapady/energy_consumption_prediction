=====Project Steps=====

1. Read the data
2. Know the data structure / data cleaning
    - null values
    - numerical distribution
3. Identify values through correlation
4. Dealing with outliers
5. Add features and treat them:
    - Assumption:
        - Appliances energy load is by hour, weekday, week, monthly
        - More energy consumed during day time then night time
        - More energy consumed on weekends than weekday 
        - When temperature and humidity is lower, energy load is lower
        - When temperature and humidity is higher, energy load is higher
6. Process and examine closely our new features  
7. Identify linear relationship
8. Train the model
